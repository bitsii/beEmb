// CONFIGURATION OPTIONS HERE
// pick one set of BESPEC_SW and BESPEC_CON to correspond to your device
// and configtype/pin use
// ard/BEH_4_Base.hpp secion is regenerated from system/cc/be/BEAR_Conf.hpp during bebuild, so
// keep this section in sync between both files
// BESPEC_SW and BESPEC_CON can also be overridden on the device later
// via commands (suggest starting with "supergeneric" options below)
//
// SW - name (type) and version of the device.  Typename 10 char max ssid rules (no spaces)
// swconfver.DeviceTypeName.DeviceVersion

// Is Reset by Pin supported - when not on network can use pin to reset device (clear all config, prep for
// re-setup).  For most (and secure) devices a physical option (button) is instead recommended, but for
// things like bulbs/less sensitive devices w/out another reasonable choice, it should be enabled.  device
// waits a bit for the wifi to come up when configured  to avoid power losses leading to entering this mode
//
#define BE_RESETBYPOW "off"
//
// tcpconsole - if you want to enable a debugish tcp port on the device (all be prints will be echoed there)
// turn BE_TCPCONSOLE on, otherwise leave off.  only for development, really only useful if serial connection
// not available.  You can telnet to the device's ip port 32259 to see the messages.  output only, no input
//
#define BE_TCPCONSOLE "off"
//
//
#define BE_APTYPE "O"
//
// Setup Code - if set to 8 character string of lower case letters this will be used as your setup code instead of
// a randomly generated one.  This can be especially useful for a BE_APTYPE of U so you don't have to search the
// console for it / so you can do headless setup if you are putting on a sealed device OTA.
//
#define BE_SCODE "na" //a non-empty value should be set, set to < 8 chars to ignore/generate random
//#define BE_SCODE "abcdefgh" //right length for use, set to 8 char lower case letters
